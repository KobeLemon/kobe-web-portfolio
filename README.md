I am currently going to school at Brigham Young University-Idaho, majoring in a **Bachelor's in Software Development**, with an emphasis in Full Stack Web Development. I am currently learning frontend development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some Python. These current projects are my own work from my classes.
