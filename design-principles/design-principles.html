            White space is heavily valued by web designer but the client who pay for the website often sees white space as a waste that could be better used for implementing other features, advertising, and other things to increase the output of the website. White space, or <strong><em>empty space</em></strong> as it can be any color, is one of the most vital tools a web designer has because it sets the pacing and comfort of the website. Too much white space makes the website feel empty and annoying to scroll through, but not enough white space makes the website feel cramped and claustrophobic.

        <p class="principle-descriptions" id="repetition-description">
            Repetition is a double-edged sword because it is very effective at making a website feel uniform when used appropriately, but when used improperly, the website will suffer. Obermayer is a great example because they only use a few colors and each color is repeated in the same elements everywhere. For example, their logo, tile titles, their footer links are all yellow and their statistics bar, footer, and search menu are all dark grey. If a website were to use too many different colors and symbols, the website is very chaotic and hard to read. If a website were to use only one color, the website would be boring and melt together.

        <p class="principle-descriptions" id="visual-hierarchy-description">
            Visual Hierarchy is very important because a web designer can use it to direct a user's attention to wherever the designer wants by using simple elements. Tesla is a great example of hierarchy because as soon as you load their website, the first thing you see is a large picture of a car right in the center. Next, you see the name of the car, then the car's stats at the bottom, then you scroll further and each feature of the car is the largest thing on the screen surrounded by the details. This principle forces the user to see the most prominent element first and get excited about it, then they are more engaged to continue scrolling.
